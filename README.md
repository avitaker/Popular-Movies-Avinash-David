# Popular-Movies-Avinash-David
Solution to Popular Movies project for Udacity Android nanodegree. I built this app from scratch and added features like responsive UI, movie review sorting options and local storage of favorite reviews.

## Features
- View popular movie reviews, sort reviews by most popular, highest rated or most rated with adjustable levels of popularity.
- Mark favorite movie reviews for local storage and offline access.
- Watch trailers
- Read reviews

## Installation and usage
- The app uses data from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API. You must first obtain an API key, and then paste it as the value for `MovieDbApiKeyProp` in `gradle.properties`
